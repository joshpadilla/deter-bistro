# SousChef
The Sous Chef

This Go software uses the [postges](https://github.com/lib/pq) and [mysql](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql) databse drivers.

This software depends on a mysql database being available at **bistrofridge.deterlab.net** with the [PizzaChef](https://github.com/DeterDevOpsTryout/PizzaChef) schema. It also depends on a postgresql database being available at **kitchen.deterlab.net** which has been initialized with the sql script contained within this repo.
