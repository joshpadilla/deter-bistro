**DETER-BISTRO AWS SERVER (EC2 INSTANCE) RESOURCES**  
DeterBistro Amazon Web Service (AWS) server (EC2 Instance) resources such as SSH Key Pairs, Region Associations, Availability Zones, Server Instance Types (CPU/RAM), Storage Types/Allocation Sizes, Operating System Types and Default Software Packages can be created manually or programmatically with AWS CloudFormation JSON templates.  

DeterBistro defines, modifies and manages AWS server (EC2 Instance) resources and infrastructure as code with CloudFormation JSON templates. This allows consistent, repeatable, code-described and version controlled server and operating system resources.  

All resources are defined in the **"AWS-Server.json"** file in the **"deter-bistro/Config/AWS-Server"** directory with lists of key, value pairs and standard JSON syntax.
